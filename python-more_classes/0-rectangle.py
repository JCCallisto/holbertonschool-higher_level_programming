Rectangle module - Basic empty class

This module provides the most basic Rectangle class definition.
This is typically used as a starting point for object-oriented programming
exercises or as a placeholder for future implementation.

class Rectangle:
    """
    A basic Rectangle class with no implementation.
    
    This is an empty class that serves as a foundation for building
    a more complete Rectangle implementation. It can be instantiated
    but has no attributes or methods defined.
    
    Examples:
        >>> rect = Rectangle()
        >>> type(rect)
        <class '__main__.Rectangle'>
        >>> rect.__class__.__name__
        'Rectangle'
